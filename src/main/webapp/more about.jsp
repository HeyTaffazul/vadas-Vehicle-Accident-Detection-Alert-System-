            <h4>A Vehicle Accident Detection and Alert System is proposed for immediate attention which could save their life.</h4>
            <p>The report from World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that approximately 1.85 million people are losing their life each year, because of road accidents.
                Nowadays,  the  rate  of accidents  has increased  rapidly. Due  to  employment, the  usage of vehicles like cars, bikes have increased, because of this reason the accidents can happen due to over speed. People are going under risk because of their over speed, due to unavailability of advanced techniques, the rate of accidents canâ€™t be decreased. To reduce the accident rate in  the  country  this  paper  introduces  a  solution.  Automatic  accident  detection  and  alert systems are introduced. The main objective is to control the accidents by sending a message to  the  registered  mobile,  hospital  and  police  station  using  wireless  communications techniques.  When  an accident  occurs  in  a  city  or  any  place,  the  message  is  sent  to  the registered mobile through GSM module in less time. Arduino is the heart of the system which helps in transferring the message to different devices in the system. Vibration sensor will be activated when the accident occurs and the information is transferred to the registered number through the GSM module. The GPS system will help in finding the location of the accident spot. The proposed system will  check whether an accident has occurred  and notify nearest medical centers and registered mobile numbers about the place of accident using GSM and GPS modules. The location can be sent through a tracking system to cover the geographical coordinates over the area. The accident can be detected by a vibration sensor which is used as a major module in the system.

                            in one shape or the other. The present transport system has minimized the distances but it has on the other
                            hand increased the life risk. Every year road crashes result in loss of lakhs of lives and serious injuries to
                            crores of people.
                            In India itself about eighty thousand people are killed in road crashes every year which is thirteen percent of
                            the total fatality all over the world. Man behind the wheel plays an important role in most of the crashes. In
                            most of the cases crashes occurs either due to carelessness or due to lack of road safety awarenessof the road
                            user. Hence, road safety education is as essential as any other basic skills of survival.
                            Our aim is to provide road safety information for road users to encourage safer road user behaviour among
                            current and prospective road users and reduce the number of people killed and injured on our roads every year "

                                 This involves implementing and enforcing standards for vehicle design,
                                  manufacturing, and maintenance. Features such as airbags, anti-lock
                                   braking systems (ABS), and electronic stability control contribute to 
                                   safer driving experiences."</p>
